	<h2> Introduction to my website: </h2>
	<p> this here is my first html webpage. I really don't have much to wright about here, So i'm just going to <b>rant</b> about the things I like such as my<br> favorite bands, movies, games, animal(s), etc just for the sake of keeping this page from being empty. So feel free to just look<br> around and enjoy your visit</p>

	<h2 title = "A brief rant about the Cat in the Hat">A movie so bad it's good: The Cat in the Hat (2003)</h2>
	<img src = "images/catinthehatresized.jpg" alt="the cat in the hat movie poster">	
	<p>The 2003 live-action adaptation of Dr. Seuss's <b>The cat in the hat</b> certainly passes off as one of those "so bad it's good" films. If you <br> don't know what that means, it just refers to a film that is excessively poor that it's way above average quality adds up to comedic <br> value thus making the movie "so bad it's good". Chances are, you're already familiar with the story, but if you're not: It just follows<br> a cat paying two kids a visit to help them have a fun day, but messes up the whole entire house in the process, simple as that. The movie <br> practically follows the same story from the original source material, but showers it with several pop culture themes and references from <br>the early 2000s, making it dated and corny as a result. Despite how dated the film is, that's part of what gives this film it's charm, and for that,<br> The cat in the hat is one of my favorite films, at least for the "so bad it's good" category. </p>

	<h2 title = "A brief rant about Papa's Pizzeria">The game of my childhood: Papa's pizzeria</h2>
	<img src = "images/resizedgameplay.jpg" alt = "screenshot of gameplay">
	<p>I don't really consider myself a gamer, but that doesn't mean I don't take the time to enjoy and appreciate a good game. There are many games I love, one of those games being <br><b>Papa's pizzeria</b>; every school's worst enemy, but yet also  every student's best friend. You basically play as an employee having to <br>run a pizzeria all by himself. the game play is rhather simple but fun, the game just involves making pizzas, specific to the customers' custom-based orders like <br> how many slices or toppings the order should have. It's simple at first, but it gets harder as more customers show up, simulating the real world restaurant workplace<br> as a result. I used to frequently play this as a kid during my free time in elementary school, there's simply a certain charm about the game that keeps it a satisfying experience. Yeah, there are other games that have the same gameplay, but barely any of them can replicate the fun experience that Papa's pizzeria did. (note: i'm not trying to encourage the habit of slacking off in school) </p>

	<h2 title = "A brief rant about Slowdive's second album: Souvlaki"> Like music out of a dream: Slowdive's Souvlaki:</h2>
	<img src = "images/reducedslowdive.jpg" alt = "album cover of slowdive's souvlaki">
	<p> <b>Slowdive</b> is a british shoegaze(a subgenere of rock music) band that was formed back in 1989. Being a music fan, I took the time to listen to some of their songs. Upon diving<br> into their discography, one of the albums that stood out to me was their second album, <i>Souvlaki</i>(as seen in the image above). What stands out about this album is their<br> dream-like sound that is present nearly throughout the album; this could all be thanks to the over-atmospheric instrumentals that even the guitars make. This album is simply like somethings out of a dream. Some songs that I would recommend is: 1. When the sun hits, 2. Alison, 3. Souvlaki space station, etc. I think it's a good listen. </p>
