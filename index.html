	<h2> Introduction to my website: </h2>

	<h2>Favorire movie: The Cat in the Hat from 2003</h2>
	<img src = "images/catinthehat.jpg" alt="the cat in the hat movie poster">	
	<p>The 2003 live-action adaptation of Dr. Seuss's The cat in the hat certainly passes off as one of those "so bad it's good films". If you <br> don't know what that means, it just refers to a film that is excessively poor that it's way above average quality adds up to comedic <br> value thus making the movie "so bad it's good". Chances are, you're already familiar with the story, but if you're not: It just follows<br> a cat paying two kids a visit to help them have a fun day, but messes up the whole entire house in the process, simple as that. The movie follows <br> practically follows the same story from the original source material but liters it with several pop culture themes/references from <br>the early 2000s, making it dated and corny as a result.Despite how dated the film is, that's part of what gives this film it's charm, and for that,<br> The cat in the hat is one of my favorite films, at least for the "so bad it's good category". </p>
